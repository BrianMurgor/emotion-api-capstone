# Final Submission Report - Emotion Detection API (Capstone Project)

## Project Title:
**Emotion Detection API using Machine Learning**

## Overview:
This project presents a FastAPI-powered web API that predicts emotional states from input numerical features using a pre-trained machine learning model. It leverages a Random Forest Classifier trained on the EmoV-DB dataset, alongside a label encoder to interpret the predicted emotion class.

## Technologies Used:
a) **FastAPI** for API framework
b) **Scikit-learn** for model training
c) **Python 3.12**
d) **Uvicorn** for running the local development server

##  Files Submitted:
a) `main.py`: FastAPI application file.
b) `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies needed to run the project.
c) `emotion_model.pkl`: Trained Random Forest emotion classifier.
d) `label_encoder.pkl`: Encoder used to decode the emotion labels.
e) `README.md`: Project documentation including setup and API usage.
f) `final_report.txt`: This report summary.

## Deployment Notes:
a) The application has been tested and confirmed working locally via FastAPI.
b)  Deployment to GCP was attempted; however, due to environment limitations, the final working version is based on the local FastAPI setup.
